## The Johnny Decimal System

The Johnny Decimal System has been devised by John Noble and there is an [entire website around this work](https://rebrand.ly/johnnyDecimal) [2](https://ricraftis.au/obsidian/how-to-set-up-an-obsidian-vault-using-the-johnny-decimal-system/#footnote_1_24975 "Home | Johnny•Decimal (johnnydecimal.com)"). The major difference between this system and those mentioned above is that the Johnny Decimal system was not developed for PKM, but for the organisation of information generally. Consequently, it can be used, not only for your PKM, but also for your Documents folder for example. So, there can be consistency in organisation systems between your PKM and all the other files on your computer. We will be focusing on PKM though in this article.

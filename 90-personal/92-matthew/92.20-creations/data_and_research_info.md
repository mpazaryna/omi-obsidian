## LSD Patent Tracker

We have gathered all of the LSD-related patents and published patent applications that were filed in the U.S. or able to be filed in the U.S. and become a U.S. patent. These start with Sandoz’s 1948 patent and go up through the most recent applications to publish.

It’s important to note that **patent applications are kept secret for at least 18 months after filing**. But keep checking back—we’ll update this table whenever new LSD-related applications become public.

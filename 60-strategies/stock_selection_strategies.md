# Fundamental Analysis

Ever heard someone say that a company has "strong fundamentals"? The phrase is so overused that it's become somewhat of a cliché. Any analyst can refer to a company's fundamentals without saying anything meaningful. So here we define precisely what fundamentals are, how and why they are analyzed, and why fundamental analysis is often a great starting point for picking good companies.

# Qualitative Analysis

Fundamental analysis has an extensive scope. Valuing a company involves not only crunching numbers and predicting cash flows but also looking at a company's general, more subjective qualities. Here we will look at how qualitative factors are used to pick a stock.

# Value Investing

Value investing is one of the best-known stock-picking methods. In the 1930s, Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, finance professors at Columbia University, laid out what many consider to be the framework for value investing. The concept is straightforward: find companies trading below their inherent worth.

The value investor looks for stocks with solid fundamentals –including earnings, dividends, book value, and cash flow –selling at a bargain price, given their quality. The value investor seeks companies that seem to be incorrectly valued (undervalued) by the market and therefore have the potential to increase in share price when the market corrects its error in valuation.

# Growth Investing

In the late 1990s, when technology companies flourished, growth investing techniques yielded unprecedented returns for investors. But before any investor jumps onto the growth investing bandwagon, he or she should realize that this strategy comes with substantial risks and is only for some.

# GARP Investing

Do you now have a firm grasp of value and growth investing principles? You're ready to learn about a newer, hybrid stock selection system if you're comfortable with these two stock selection methodologies. Here we look at growth at a reasonable price, otherwise known as GARP.

# Income Investing

Income investing, which aims to pick companies with a steady income stream, is one of the most straightforward stock-picking strategies. When investors think of steady income, they commonly think of fixed-income securities such as bonds. However, stocks can also provide a steady income by paying a solid dividend. Here we look at the strategy that focuses on finding these stocks.

# CANSLIM

CANSLIM is a philosophy of screening, purchasing, and selling common stock. Developed by William O'Neil, the co-founder of _Investor's Business Daily_, it is described in his highly recommended book _How to Make Money in Stocks_.

The name may suggest some boring government agencies, but this acronym represents a very successful investment strategy. What makes CANSLIM different is its attention to tangibles, such as earnings, and intangibles, such as overall strength and ideas in the company. The best thing about this strategy is that there's evidence that it works. There are countless examples of companies that, over the last half of the twentieth century, met CANSLIM criteria before increasing enormously in price. This section explores each of the seven components of the CANSLIM system.

# Dogs of the Dow

The investing strategy focusing on 'Dogs of the Dow' was popularized by Michael Higgins in his book, _Beating the Dow_. The strategy's simplicity is one of its most attractive attributes. The Dogs of the Dow are 10 of the 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) with the highest dividend yield. In the Dogs of the Dow strategy, the investor shuffles around his or her portfolio, adjusting it so that it is always equally allocated in each of these 10 stocks.

Typically, such an investor would need to completely rid his or her portfolio of about three to four stocks yearly and replace them with different ones. The stocks are usually replaced because their dividend yields have fallen out of the top 10 or occasionally because they have been removed from the DJIA altogether.

# Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is the polar opposite of fundamental analysis, which is the basis of every method explored in this tutorial. Technical analysts, or technicians, select stocks by analyzing statistics generated by past market activity, prices, and volumes. Sometimes also known as chartists, technical analysts look at past charts of prices and different indicators to make inferences about the future movement of a stock's price.
